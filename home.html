Hello friends! My name is Erin Sheffer and I love crocheting. I started this page because I wanted to create a platform for everyone 
who wants to find cool crocheting patterns and ideas and where people can learn a little bit more about crocheting and can
 see just how fun having a hobby can be. Below you will be able to access my other pages on crocheting. I have 1 website page 
that is more about the orgins and history of crocheting where my other page is about different patterns and pieces that you can
 make. This page is to introduce you to my website and to have a homebase to navigate through the web. Thank you for being here and I hope that
 you enjoy my content, cheers!
