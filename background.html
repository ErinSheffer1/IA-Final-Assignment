Hello friends! This page is to communicate a few fun facts about crocheting and the history of crocheting. Did you know that crocheting was developed in the 19th century as a form of chain-stitch enbroidery done with a hook instead of a needle. Another fun fact for you is crocheting was introduced into Ireland in the late 1840s as a famine relief measure. Originally crocheting was commonly used to make items like clothing decoration, religious items, and military uniforms in the middle ages. Although crocheting wasn't introduced into North America until around the mid 19th century, similar techniques have been discovered in Israel as early as 6500 BC. Some possible orgins are Arabia, indigenous South American tribes and Chinese needlewor techniques as well.
